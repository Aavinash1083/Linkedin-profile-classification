So now a government funded agency (OCE) has paid them $3M to take over and run the co-working space instead. I can't help but feel for the privately operated, vibrant co-working spaces such as Workhaus, Make Lemonade Co. Ltd. Spaces. offices | co-working | meeting rooms., East Room StartWell Project Spaces, Clearspace Eureka Building + Eureka Hub even WeWork and Breather ... who are already struggling to survive in this environment and who will now find themselves competing with a huge amount of taxpayer-funded co-working space. Further, I would not categorize OneEleven as an accelerator, but rather as flexible office space for tech companies (similar to WeWork and the others). Equity is not taken in any of the companies, time-limits are not in place and investments are not made as a condition of selection. Companies pay market rent to be there. https://lnkd.in/gU4MHxv cc.

My first real experience with Techstars was attending a Foundercon in Cincinnati, OH several years ago. It was this experience which demonstrated to me how special Techstars really is. It was incredible to see a downtown of an American city taken over by hundreds of people wearing our (then) green t-shirts and Techstars logos. At the time we had about 1200 portfolio companies. Now we have 2300 and counting (!!).

It would be interesting to know what percentage of announced funding goes to administer and staff the delivery organization non-profit themselves (and to use these metrics to help measure success and overall impact). As a point of reference, at Techstars we are just 2 people in Toronto (and 6 across 3 accelerators in Canada) and at Founder Institute we have 0 FTEs in Canada. ""In fact, the PM had announced a $912-million program, enough for more than 180,000 volunteers, but that wasn‚Äôt going to happen.

This is the largest and most diverse group of early-stage entrepreneurs ever assembled in the history of FI - which spans 11 years, 65 countries, 200 cities and 600 cohorts (so largest in the world!)

Thank you to all the mentors - many Techstars founders who are giving back to the next generation but also many other prominent and experienced tech and business leaders who have been spending time delivering sessions and hosting countless office hours listening to and helping these founders.

I expect that 40-50 new tech startups will come from this here in Canada by September 2020. More than 200 have been created so far.

We met more than 500 entrepreneurs during that period, but something stood out about Dan DeMers and Karanjot Jaswal. They had a huge vision, highly developed software and a relentless work ethic. We knew that this was what Techstars was all about, and we shortlisted them and quickly made our investment. During the months of Techstars, the Cinchy team spent countless days and nights in a small windowless boardroom which they selected as their work area (introverts, right?). By the end of the program (and with help from the Tariq Haddadin pitch coaching regimen) Dan delivered an incredible Demo Day pitch and the ball was really rolling.

We are proud to be making our 3rd investment into Cinchy right now alongside some amazing new investors. As both Dan and Karanjot say in their blog this morning, this is just the beginning.

And my response to them was the same, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sew masks and I don‚Äôt know how to make ventilators.‚Äù But after thinking about it, it dawned on to me that we could contribute ‚Äì by creating a class to help existing businesses recover and new ones to start.

And so, Hacking for Recovery began, starting first at Stanford and next offered by University of Hawaii for the State of Hawaii. Here's a look at the progress 70 teams made in the classes. #Hacking4Recovery #teaching #teachingandlearning #entrepreneurshipeducation #entrepreneurship #innovation #leanstartup #LeanLaunchPad #startupsuccess #startups
